File names were originally presented in this format:

{DATE}_{READ}_{M[N]}_{TREATMENT}.fq.gz

DATE: 051915 is the 6hr timepoint, and 080515 is the 1hr.
M[N]: Treatment replicate
READ: Either the forward or reverse read.


File names were renamed to follow this format during trimming:

{time exposed to treatment}_{replicate number}_{treated vs untreated}_{lane number}_{forward or reverse paired-end read}.fq.gz

For example, 1h_m1_t_l1_1P.fq.gz is the first (forward or reverse) read for mouse 1 treated with hexadecenoic acid for an hour before LPS administration.
